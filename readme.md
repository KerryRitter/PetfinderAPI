#Petfinder API

This is a PHP implementation of an interface to interact with Petfinder's API. It is currently a work in progress. It currently allows you get pets for a given shelter and filter the returned data by species, breed, and status (available for adoption, adopted/removed, on hold, or pending).

Feel free to fork and add or improve!
